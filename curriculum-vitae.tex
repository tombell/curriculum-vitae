\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{I have been writing code since the late 90's, where I wrote BASIC
from magazines onto a Commodore 64 with an uncle. Since then I have always found
interest in programming and building interesting projects. I have picked up many
programming languages over the years ranging from C/CPP, to PHP/Ruby, to modern
JavaScript/TypeScript and Go.}

\paragraph{I value clean code that is easy to pick up and understand, especially
for people new to a code base. Including setting up code licode linters and
formatters to maintain quality and consistency.}

\paragraph{I have worked on desktop apps, mobile apps, distributed apps, and
server side apps. I have settled on being a full-stack developer, making use of
modern JavaScript on the front-end. Outside of work, I have developed a numer of
productivity tools for macOS.}

\section{Experience}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{Residently} Senior Software Engineer}{2019---Present}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed and deployed various Ruby on Rails API apps. For different
    stages of renting from the application process to contract generation.
  \item Started Next.js apps for resident and partner facing apps. Communicating
    with our APIs via JSON API.
  \item Worked on the mobile app built with React-Native for residents, and
    testing with Detox.
  \item Created a system for documenting conventions. Where engineers could
    document our preferred ways of building and testing. Including service
    objects, mocking in tests, and performing code reviews.
  \item Created a system that processes incoming emails, and messages from the
    mobile app. Displayed as conversations in the mobile app.
  \item Added and maintained linting/formatting workflows to our Ruby and
    JavaScript/TypeScript apps.
  \item Mentored junior engineers with topics including Ruby, Rails, RSpec,
    TypeScript, Jest, and refactoring.
  \item Worked alongside product managers and designers.
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{Capsule} Software Developer}{2012---2019}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Capsule Mobile} - built using Cordova, Backbone, and
    CoffeeScript. The app used the public API to synchronise data. Store it
    (Web SQL) so the app could work offline, and then reconcile the offline data
    with online data.
  \item \textbf{Capsule for Gmail} - built using JavaScript and the Gmail add-on
    SDK. This made CRM data available inside emails within Gmail. Also giving
    the ability to store the emails in the CRM, and access to other CRM
    features.
  \item \textbf{Capsule Connector for Google Data Studio} - built using
    JavaScript and the data studio SDK. The connector allows Google Data Studio
    to pull in CRM data. Allowing users to create dashboard and other data
    visualisations.
  \item Built internal dashboards, monitoring, and CI/CD tools.
\end{itemize}
