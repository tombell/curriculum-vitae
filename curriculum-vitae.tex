\section{Introduction}
\small{TODO}

\section{Experience}
\datedsubsection{\textbf{Residently} -- Software Engineer}{2019 -- Present}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Worked on a various Ruby on Rails API apps for different stages of renting from the application process to contract generation.
  \item Started Next based React apps for resident and partner facing apps communicating with our APIs via JSON API.
  \item Worked on the mobile app built with React-Native for residents, and testing with Detox.
  \item Created a system that handles incoming emails, and support messages from residents, so everything is routed and grouped conversationally correctly. 
  \item Added and maintained a linting (ESLint/Rubocop) and formatting (Prettier) workflow in our Ruby and JavaScript/TypeScript apps.
  \item Created a system for \textit{conventions} whereby engineers could document our preferred ways of building and testing things, such as service objects, mocking in tests, and performing code reviews.
  \item Helped mentor junior engineers with things like Ruby, Rails, RSpec, TypeScript, Jest, and refactoring.
\end{itemize}
\datedsubsection{\textbf{Capsule} -- Software Developer}{2012 -- 2019}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Capsule Mobile} -- built using Cordova, Backbone, and CoffeeScript (eventually converted to ES6 JavaScript). The app used the public API to synchronise data, and store it (Web SQL) so the app could work offline, and then reconcile the offline data with online data.
  \item \textbf{Capsule for Gmail} -- built using JavaScript and the Gmail add on SDK. This made CRM  data available inside emails within Gmail, and gave the ability to store the emails in the CRM, and access to other CRM features.
  \item \textbf{Capsule Connector for Google Data Studio} -- built using JavaScript and the data studio SDK, the connector allows Google Data Studio to pull in CRM data, which allows users to create dashboard and other data visualisations.
  \item Worked on internal dashboards, monitoring, and CI/CD tools.
\end{itemize}

\section{Hobbies}
\paragraph{My main hobby at the minute is DJing. I first learnt to DJ back in 2018 and have been honing and learning new skills consistently. I often perform a 1 to 2 hour mix weekly live on \href{https://twitch.tv/iamdjriff}{Twitch}.}
\paragraph{I've built and maintained several side projects. A typical side project for me is something that helps increase productivity.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/starkwm/stark}{Stark} \languagetag{(Swift)} Window manager powered by JavaScript for macOS
  \item \href{https://github.com/tombell/skbd}{skbd} \languagetag{(Swift)} Daemon for binding shell commands to shortcut keys for macOS
  \item \href{https://github.com/tombell/memoir}{Memoir API} \languagetag{(Go)} \href{https://github.com/tombell/memoir-app}{Memoir App} \languagetag{(TypeScript, Preact)} Web app for sharing tracklists for my DJ mixes
  \item \href{https://github.com/tombell/legend}{Legend} \languagetag{(Go, TypeScript, Preact)} API service and web overlay for OBS for displaying the currently playing track(s) in Rekordbox
  \item \href{https://github.com/tombell/ensong}{Ensong} \languagetag{(Go)} Deamon that watches a directory for a WAV file, converts to AIFF and MP3 to backup and upload to Mixcloud
