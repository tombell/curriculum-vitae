\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{I've been coding since the late 90s, starting with BASIC on a
Commodore 64 with my uncle. Since then, I've been passionate about programming
and have learned several languages including Ruby and Go, and modern
JavaScript/TypeScript.}

\paragraph{I prioritize clean code that's easy for newcomers to understand,
emphasizing the importance of setting up code linters and formatters to ensure
quality and consistency.}

\paragraph{I've gained experience developing desktop, mobile, distributed, and
server-side applications. As a full-stack developer, I specialize in modern
JavaScript for front-end development. Beyond my professional work, I've also
created several productivity tools for macOS, and my hobbies.}
